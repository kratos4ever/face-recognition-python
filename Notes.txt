1. Load the facial recognition model file
2. Start the main loop -> 

If the prediction score for the face is less than 1200 -> then set 
the name as 'unidentified'

Always train on the s1 as 'unknown' person. so, whatever may be the face that is not 
the agent's it will be tagged as 'unknown'

Print the length of the faces array as the number of faces detected. -> if it is 
0, then print the room status as unoccupied
