1. Load the facial recognition model file
2. Start the main loop -> 

If the prediction score for the face is less than 1200 -> then set 
the name as 'unidentified'

Always train on the s1 as 'unknown' person. so, whatever may be the face that is not 
the agent's it will be tagged as 'unknown'

Print the length of the faces array as the number of faces detected. -> if it is 
0, then print the room status as unoccupied

Performane of the deep learning based desk status detection is quite slow - avg over 0.5 sec/image. hard to even keep up with a 2 to 1 frames/sec from the camera.
OpenCV based? - NOT POSSIBLE
faster deep learning options than tensorflow? on CPU - OR May be do object detection in the frame using either OpenCV or Deep learning/tensorflow -> if any 
objects are identified in the frame as paper, pen, tablet, phone, ?? How to detect working vs not working?


The results are best viewed as updates vs live stream video with status printed on top, as the framerate is quite low because of the tensorflow based desk/agent status
classifier.

Live updates can be viewed as discrete messages/rows coming into a table by timestamp with a status mesage and the link of the vide image analyzed.
